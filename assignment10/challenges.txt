Task 6 
describe any challenges you faced in completing this assignment and how you resolved them



One challenge was figuring out the correct XPath to target only the Top 10 items since the page had other links as well. I had to inspect the page source carefully. Another challenge was that some class names were long so I used XPath with partial class matching. Using headless mode with Selenium helped avoid pop-ups during this assignment.
